A simple two player true and false quiz.
When player clicks the answer, the quiz gives feedback about whether the player got it right. It also displays an explanation of why the answer is true/false. Useful for people who want to learn a little bit more about Physics, Philosophy and History of computers.

Question changes when user clicks the next question button for the explanation page.

Questions are randomised and will not repeat. This was done using a recursive loop.

Tried to do something where players can choose one of two quizzes, but wasn't able to do it, because when one quiz is already playing, can't really stop the function that runs the quiz, so every click of answer ends up doing two things at the same time. i.e. turn increases by two rather than one. Couldn't figure that one out.
